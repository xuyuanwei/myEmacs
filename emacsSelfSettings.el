;; ========== Line by line scrolling ==========

;; This makes the buffer scroll by only a single line when the up or
;; down cursor keys push the cursor (tool-bar-mode) outside the
;; buffer. The standard emacs behaviour is to reposition the cursor in
;; the center of the screen, but this can make the scrolling confusing

;; Emacs normally uses both tabs and spaces to indent lines. If you

;; disabled for all buffers.
